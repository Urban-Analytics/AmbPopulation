# Modelling ambient populations under different restriction schemes

## Project summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on urban mobility,
leading to two major questions: (i) how have cities changed during the
pandemic? and (ii) which changes will remain as the pandemic
subsides? To help answer these questions, this project will build on
previous CDRC-funded work to create a spatio-temporal machinelearning model to
estimate footfall around Leeds. It will consider the
local urban configuration, external factors (such as public holidays and
local weather conditions) and, importantly, the impact of various
mobility restriction measures. First, the model will be trained using data
from the years before the pandemic, and then lockdown restriction
conditions like the “rule of six” and closing/opening of non-essential
retails will be incorporated. Given the wide spatial distribution in the
available footfall sensor data in the case study area (Leeds), the model
will be able to estimate the overall change in footfall, as well as the
heterogeneous impacts that restrictions will have on different local
areas. The model will also allow analysis about city occupation in
different scenarios.
In summary the project will:

- Develop a suitable open-source footfall machine-learning model
- Calibrate and validate the model using footfall data from the
CDRC (SmartStreetSensors) and from Leeds City Council (footfall
cameras)
- Develop a dashboard to present maps and related visual outputs
to help policy makers to easily explore different scenarios

The project partners, Leeds City Council, have a particular interest in
better estimating how footfall in city-centre will vary as the pandemic,
and related policies, evolve. Hence a specific case study will be
designed around their immediate policy objectives at the start of the
project, taking into account current conditions.

Although based on Leeds, the work will be generalisable to other cities
that have footfall estimates and, once the model has been trained,
could even be applied even where footfall data do not exist. Ultimately
we aspire to attract further funding to create a nationwide footfall
model, which would represent a great methodological advance as well
as a contribution to outcomes like improving public health and creating
better living standards. This would also represent an extremely
attractive outcome for the CDRC.

This project builds on the prototype machine-learning model developed as
part of a previous CDRC-funded internship¹ and will use the data insight
gained through a forthcoming project²:

1. Predictive data analytics for urban footfall - CDRC-funded internship
(2017) attempting to quantify and model ambient populations
2. Measuring Ambient Populations during COVID in Leeds City Centre -
CDRC-funded internship, starting April 2021

This project also aligns with a number of projects conducted at UoL in
collaboration with partners:

- Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP): Urban Analytics.
The RAMP:UA project will benefit from an improved understanding
about how city centre usage varies under different lockdown
scenarios as a means of informing its estimates of population
mobility during lockdown. This project therefore offers an opportunity
for the CDRC to exploit links with RAMP partners in government and
academia.
- Data Assimilation for Agent-Based Models (DUST) requires up-to-date
footfall estimates to inform its real-time population mobility models
so will benefit from the model produced here.
- Analysing COVID-19 Mobility Responses through Passively Collected
App Data - CDRC-funded internship. This LIDA project is analysing
smart-phone generated mobility traces from Cuebiq data, and this
data can inform this project as well.
- Bringing the Social City to the Smart City (ESRC-Turing) will benefit
from a greater understanding about how the dynamics of cities
changes under government.
